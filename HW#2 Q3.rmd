#a
```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

fanbase <- read_excel("FanBase.xls")

fanbase$logTime <- log(fanbase$Time)

model <- aov(logTime ~ Person, data = fanbase)

TukeyHSD(model)
```

#b
```{r}
# Use Tukey’s HSD, because it gives confidence intervals for all pairwise comparisons while controlling
# error rates. 

# Fisher’s LSD would be too liberal here. Bonferroni and Scheffé both control error rates, but they are
# much more conservative than Tukey’s HSD. 
```

#c
```{r}
# It should be a contrast, because the question is asking if TS is faster than all the others combined, 
# not just one friend versus another.

# The contrast would be TS vs mean of seven other groups.
# That requires setting up a contrast.
```
